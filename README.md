<h1> eCommerce </h1>

Commerce is fully responsive, the website allows users to browse and purchase products online. It features a shopping cart functionality where users can add products they wish to buy. Additionally, users can register on the website to create an account.

However, only the administrator has the privilege to add new products to the website. The admin is responsible for managing the inventory and ensuring that the product catalog stays up to date.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
